# Forge - No-Code Application Development in Pascal

**Forge** is a no-code application for developing forms and applications, created in Pascal, initially designed as a language study project. Developed in **Lazarus / Free Pascal**, the application aims to simplify the creation of graphical interfaces without the need for manual coding. In the future, the project will also be compatible with **Delphi**.

## 🔧 Upcoming Development Steps

Here are the main goals and improvements planned for the future of Forge:

### 🔨 Adjustments in RuntimeForm
- Improvements in the management of **Events in RuntimeForm** to produce more robust applications.

### 🧩 Component Board Adjustment
- Implementation of a **scrollview** in the component board, allowing the creation of windows larger than the available space in the IDE interface.

### ⚙️ New Types of Events
- Addition of **new types of events**:
  - **Binding 1 or more events**.
  - **Customizable events**, which can be defined with **pseudocode** or **custom scripts**.

### 🎨 New Components in the Palette
- Inclusion of new components in the tool palette for creating more dynamic interfaces.

### 🖥️ Editing Multiple Forms Simultaneously
- Feature to allow **editing multiple forms simultaneously**, making it easier to develop complex projects.

### 📂 Project File
- Creation of a project file that supports the design of **multi-screen applications**.

### 📊 Inclusion of Dataset Components and Connectors
- Implementation of **dataset components** to work with databases.
- Addition of **HTTP and standard SQL connectors** for external data integration.

### 🏗️ Build as a Single EXE
- Development of a feature to perform **builds into a single executable** (`.exe`), simplifying the distribution of the project.
